# SmartLoan: A Decentralised Smart Contract Solution to Student Debt Crisis!
## Keeping Up with Credential Inflation
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The advancement of technology has caused increasing demand for skilled workers and credential inflation among professionals. This phenomena pushes every average people to pursue higher education in order to survive the paradigm shift of the world. Therefore, more and more people are getting into graduate schools, either in their early career or middle of their career. 

Student debt is not just a trillion dollar crisis in the United States. It is a worldwide problem. A group that oversees the government’s student loan system in Japan reported that it has been lending over $9 billion to students yearly since 2010. Similar situation happens in Africa and South America.
At the same time, governments are investing less money in public colleges and universities. Although most of the countries (example: Malaysia and Singapore) raised the budget for public education, the larger percentage of the budget allocation is to develop the primary and secondary education. Financial support for graduate school and research is still very limited.

As for the 40 countries with free graduate school tuition, for example in Germany. Although the system were praised worldwide to be a success, it cannot deny the fact that more than two-thirds of the annual funds invested in research come from industry. Companies either conduct research themselves or collaborate with research partners. Researchers are supported not only with job offers, but also with scholarships and prizes from corporate foundations. Although corporate funding are well received, such approach might raise a conflict of interest between corporate benefits vs scientific integrity.
For various reasons, the debate of whether graduate school should be free or not, it still depends on countries’ government and policy makers. However, as a simple everyday person who eager to learn, research and advancing our skills, we came into a situation that there are limited financial services and products to choose in order to finance our education. The existing student loan packages are flawed and can be predatory towards the prospective students.
Furthermore, the scholarships, sponsorship and grant awards that are available mostly are reserved for young, elite or students from under-developed countries. This has put a limit to every average people who intend to learn, serve and contribute. Many existing meritocratic awarding system is flawed in a sense when the award is given to young elite few who are not financially poor.  

## The Scenario
Asvoria is a 37 years old Malaysian single adult who wish to pursue a PHD by research and she got an offer to do her research in a public university in United Kingdom. Her tuition fee total about £23k and need living costs total of £37k over 3 years. However, due to her age and average performance, she might not be eligible for most of the scholarships and sponsorships which mostly are looking for students who are younger, poorer and with better scores. 
Given the above scenario, Asvoria is looking for a loan to support her livelihood during her years pursuing her PHD in UK. The total amount of loan she’s taking is £60k for the duration of her study of 3 years. She’s not eligible for most education loan products in Malaysia. Therefore, personal loan came in place. However, it is impossible for any banks in Malaysia to provide a personal loan of £60k. Therefore, PHD is a wishful thinking for her even though she met the technical qualification and received an offer letter from the university.

## What if…
What if there is an institution which would offer Asvoria a student loan? According to traditional loan calculator, Asvoria’s student loan repayment scheme will be:

## The Crisis
After Asvoria graduates, if she unable to find a job in UK, and must go back to Malaysia. She might get herself a job lecturing in Universities. The crisis begins when her salary was paid in MYR and the average salary of a PHD holder lecturer in Malaysia is about RM10k per month. Which is only about £1.787k per month. In such circumstances, she might not able to pay the monthly instalment of her education loan, which is about £0.97k. 
However, if she found a job in UK as an engineering PHD graduate, the average salary according to payscale, is about £43.6k (which is about £3.6k per month). Asvoria might still able to repay the loan by living a frugal life for 10 years.
From the above example, we see that the system is flawed, in a sense that the financial product is not “future proof”. As future is something unpredictable, and it is a form of investment risk to the money lender and a financial risk for the borrower. Although in the United States, PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) program seeks to help those who work for public services and non-profit organizations. However, such system does not help people who choose to serve independently. For example, a graduated physician who want to open their own family clinic in a rural under-serve area, they may not qualify for PSLF.

## The Proposed Solution
SmartLoan is a dApp that helps average person to generate smart student loan contracts. The uniqueness of SmartLoan is that the interest is calculated based on the debtor’s income instead of the fixed percentage of the amount borrowed. With dynamic interest rates, ranging from 18% to -5% based on the career path taken by the borrower.

The contract begins with total fund of £80k, only £20k will be released each year depends on the student’s performance. For a PHD by research, average year of study is 3 years. The contract is programmed to limit failure to achieve yearly milestone for maximum 2 times. This is to prevent circumstances when a student accumulates more debts but still unable to graduate with the PHD. If the student performs well and able to graduate less than 3 years, less debt will be accumulated.
If the student graduate early, additional interests is charged since early graduation is a sign showing the student has higher potential and the additional interests is to reward the lender. For example: if the student able to graduate after first year of study, 1% of the interest is charged based on total amount of A1=£20k loan, which is £200 as a reward for the lenders, since the other T1=£60k is not released to the student, they will be returned to the lenders, and the student shall start repay the total amount of £20.2k by instalment.   
If the student failed to graduate and decided to drop out of the program, 1.5% interest will be charged as penalty. For example: if the student decided to drop out of the program after year 2, 1.5% of A1=£40k will be charged, which is £600, as penalty for unable to complete the program. The student shall start repay the total amount of £40.6k by instalment.  
Penalty interest (P1) and reward interest (R1, R2) are variables that can be changed based on the student’s ability when the contract being formulated. P1 should be larger than R1, and R1 should be larger than R2 (P1>R1>R2) to encourage student to work hard for graduation, at the same time, compensate and reward the lenders when the total accumulated debt is less than contract total.
